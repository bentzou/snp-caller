### Bayesian SNP Caller

SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, are single base differences between two DNA sequences. The two DNA sequences are generally referred to as the reference sequence and sample sequence.

Due to the limitations of DNA sequencing technology, the sample sequence often exists not as one contiguous sequence but many short sequences called reads. These reads are each mapped to the reference sequence with some statistical confidence. The reference sequence and the reads with their mappings are often succintly summarized in a format called 'pileup.'

The code here provides a Bayesian framework for identifying SNPs from pileup data generated by SAMtools. Speed is comparable to existing SNP callers, such as GATK or samtools. Output is in VCF format.

### How to run the code

To run this code on pileup data:

```python snp-caller.py pileup```

Or, piped from samtools mpileup:

```samtools mpileup -Df reference.fa reads.bam | python snp-caller.py```
